# Gallery

I'm not really doing much here. Just making a simple gallery module that one will eventually be able to configure easily. It uses a couple repositories in combination. I've just kind of glued the two together.

Powered by [light Gallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/)

And starting Galler template [Thumbnail Gallery](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/thumbnail-gallery/)

## Install

2. Copy the files to your HTML directory.
3. Edit the configuration (To come)
